# Data Structure and algorithms 

This repository will be used to store different types of algorithms and data structures to practice and learn diferent type of data structures and algorithms



# Language used 

- **C :** will be the primary language using **C89**, **C99** and **C11**

(can be done in other languages such as python, javascript and more)

# Already Made it
